A Rimworld mod that adds a few psycasts to the Royalty expansion.

Awaken Mechanites (level 2, 20 entropy) - Awaken latent mechanites in the target's body. This is priced as a cheaper version of Focus, as the buffs are less powerful and the pain and tiredness make for medium-term consequences.

Heart Attack (level 4, 30 entropy) - Causes target to suffer a heart attack, inflicting a variety of debuffs. Priced cheaper than Berserk, which is strictly better.

Entomb (level 5, 30 entropy) - Summons short-lived walls around a position, allowing, unlike Wallraise, to briefly emprison a target.

Two more psycasts are added when Rimworld of Magic is enabled.

Silence (level 3, 20 entropy) - Silences a target, preventing it from using magic. Priced cheaper than Berserk, which is strictly better.

Silence Pulse (level 5, 40 entropy) - Silences targets in an area, preventing them from using magic. Priced cheaper than Berserk Pulse.
